```
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
```

When evaluating user needs, one should establish direct communication with the user base. This creates a clear idea of what is expected from your program and allows one to gather ideas that users might have that may never have occured to the developers. User stories take these conversations with users and encapsulate them in precise, single goals that may be reached by the development team. This outlines, clearly, the relationship between what ought to be done and what the users want, and then once the work is done, can be used to evaluate what has been done against what the users need.

In my personal project, I have often done a bulk of planning before implementing any code to ensure that I have a solid foundation to work on for my, usually very small and single purpose, programs. In the future, I believe it will be valuable to implement a structured agile approach to some of what I do, including keeping a backlog of features I intend to include and working on them, both in terms of implementation and clarifying detail, based on priority.

In software development, a good team member is able to support the rest of the team. This includes being respectful and having developed "soft" skills, but also includes support in job responsibilities. These job responsibilities may be pairing with other team members to assist with areas that they are less experienced in, taking initiative on difficult tasks that your skillset may be valuable to, or creating enough documentation to allow others to understand and make necessary changes to your code.
